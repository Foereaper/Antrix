Priest:

Shadow talents:
Talents:

Misery; should make shadow word: pain, mind flay, and vampiric touch increase target spell damage taken by 5%; does not work at all.

Focused Mind; should reduce mana cost of mind blast, mind control, and mind flay by 15%; does not work at all (I think).

Disciple:

Talent : Inner Focus

What it does : Instant / 3min cooldown / When activated , reduces the mana cost of your next spell by 100% and increases its critical effect chance by 25% if it is capable of a critical strike

Spells:

	Psychic Scream - may need the break chance fixed

	Mind Control - When used on anyone besides an NPC, the mind controlled victim is unusable.
